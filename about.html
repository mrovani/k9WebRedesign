<p>Founded in March 2012, K9s 4 Mobility, Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to enriching the lives of others through the training, placement and support of Assistance Dog Partnerships.</p>

<p>In September 2017, we have trained and placed twenty two assistance dogs, enriching the lives of their owners by enhancing their mobility, increasing their independence and confidence, and providing devoted companionship.</p>

<p>K9s 4 Mobility, Inc. is proud to offer training and support to any assistance dog team, regardless of where the dog was obtained.</p>

<p>Each Assistance Dog is specifically selected and trained for an individual, making sure that the personalities, size and skills needed are right for the partnership to be successful. The placements are made in the individuals home and involves one on one attention for 10-12 days.</p>
